# Movie-Success-Prediction
'Predicting a movieâ€™s opening success is a difficult problem, since it does not always depend on its quality only. External factors such as competing movies, time of the year and even weather influence the success as these factors impact the Box Office sales for the moving opening. The objective of our project is to predict the success of a movie based on attributes such as the actors involved, directors, year in which they were released, movie genre, total runtime of movie, user rating, number of votes, total revenue generated by movie, the overall metascore, age of the users watching and recording the votes or rating, the geographical areas where movie was released, any other influences such as political movements, ongoing trends, and so on.
